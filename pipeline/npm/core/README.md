## About `nlbridge`

`@lbridge` is a Node.js library that provides utilities, middleware, and a development server for building APIs
powered by large language models.

This package `@nlbridge/core` provides utilities, types, and functions for building custom APIs that connect to large
language models. It's designed to easily integrate with [`nlux`](https://nlux.ai), the conversational UI library by the
same team, but `nlbridge` can also be used independently with any Node.js server and frontend.

## `nlbridge` with Express.js

To use the `nlbridge` with Express.js, you can use the [@nlbridge/express]() package. It provides an Express.js
middleware for `nlbridge` and it offers an simple and powerful way to build custom APIs that connect to large
language models.

## `nlbridge` Dev Server

If you are looking for a quick way to start a development server with an `nlbridge` API, you can use the
[@nlbridge/server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlbridge/server) package. It provides a CLI to start a development
server with a simple command.
